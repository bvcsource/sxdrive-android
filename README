- Look at app/build.gradle:
    compileSdkVersion 22
    buildToolsVersion "22.0.1"
  you need android sdk 22 and build tools v22.0.1
- Download latest ndk
- put this directory/repo inside sx root, you can call it SXDrive
- cd in that directory and run ./bindgen.sh (you need swig)
- download openssl-1.0.1m.tar.gz in 3rdparty subdirectory
- unpack openssl-1.0.1m.tar.gz package then symlink openssl-1.0.1m to openssl
- cd in the openssl directory and copy the content of SXDrive/import_openssl here
- run: ./import_openssl.sh import ../openssl-1.0.1m.tar.gz
- in SXDrive directory: edit local.properties adding sdk/ndk paths and jobs numbers
- create a file named gradle.properties and put your keystore properties as follow
RELEASE_STORE_FILE=/home/sherpya/skylable.keystore
RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=skylable
RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=skylable
RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=skylable
- run ./convert_icons.py (you need rsvg-convert)
- run ./gradlew assembleRelease
- your signed apk is ./app/build/outputs/apk/app-release.apk
